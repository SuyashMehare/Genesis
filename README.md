Welcome to my Breakout (Brick Breaker) game project! This is a JavaScript-based recreation of the classic Atari arcade game where you control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks.

Features
Smooth paddle movement (mouse or keyboard controls)

Ball physics with collision detection (walls, paddle, and bricks)

Score tracking and level progression

Game over detection with reset functionality

Endless randomly generated brick layouts

Built with HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript, this project was a fun way to explore core game development concepts like rendering, collision detection, and game state management.

Feel free to play the game, tweak the code, or contribute improvements!

(A nostalgic throwback to retro gaming!)
